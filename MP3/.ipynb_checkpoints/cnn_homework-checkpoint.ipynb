    "1. Design and train an ANN classifier to determine if an image contains an ellipse or rectangle (both or neither not considered). Please do not use an off-the-shelf model, write a CNN using standard building blocks available in PyTorch or TensorFlow and train from scratch. The classification task is easy enough that you do not need a sophisticated model nor do you need to do extensive training.\n",

    "You may use whatever framework you find most comfortable. To save time, I've included a data generator class which creates examples on the fly instead of giving you image data. I wrote this generator for a PyTorch model, so apologies if it is difficult to use with TF. The parameters for the shapes (e,g. radius, centroid, ...) are all random. Additionally, the image is corrupted with a small abount of noise. The generator is used (with PyTorch) as\n",
